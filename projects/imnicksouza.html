                    <p>Building this website for a college friend has been very satisfying for me personally. Nick requested help building his own personal portfolio with the objective of sharing his videos. I was able to set him up with the exact domain name he wanted, purchased through a quality web hosting service. I utilized Amazon Web Services to host Nick's new domain economically and reliably. The result exceeded his expectations.</p>
